# USBHUB version 2 PCB

I have made a preview one with another chip, which ended up to be too complicated for my purpose, it worked but this has less components to solder.
This version has 2 mosfet which needs to be connected to a pin 5V or just removed from the schematic. It was for my personal project but no needed if you need a normal usb hub.

The schematic was inspired by: https://github.com/richardhawthorn/piZero-Hub

I used SI2301CDS-T1-E3  as Mosfet to make sure there can handle enough Ampere.
